  "version": "1.0",
  "date": "2025-09-02",
  "author": "John (PM Agent)",
  "goals": {
    "primary": [
      "Enable systematic hazard identification and analysis through structured HazOps methodology automation",
      "Provide comprehensive P&ID interpretation and interactive node-based analysis capabilities",
      "Integrate risk assessment, LOPA analysis, and regulatory compliance validation into unified workflow",
      "Generate professional-quality reports and documentation suitable for regulatory submission and stakeholder communication",
      "Streamline HazOps process efficiency while maintaining engineering rigor and safety standards"
    ]
  },
  "backgroundContext": "The process industry currently relies on fragmented toolchains for conducting Hazard and Operability Studies (HazOps), combining manual P&ID review, spreadsheet-based analysis tracking, and separate risk assessment tools. This fragmentation leads to inconsistencies, increased analysis time, and potential gaps in safety coverage. The HazOp Assistant addresses this by providing an integrated platform that guides engineers through established HazOps methodology while automating documentation, risk assessment, and compliance validation.",
