NEXT STEP:
After filling this in, also create/update PRD.json with structured requirements.
Then ask Claude:

"Read PROMPT.md and PRD.json. Generate a complete IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with:
- All tasks broken into phases
- Each task completable in 1-2 hours
- Task IDs with prefixes (SETUP-, DB-, API-, UI-, etc)
- Clear acceptance criteria implied in task names

Then update CLAUDE.md with the project overview, tech stack, and domain knowledge.
After that, begin Ralph workflow."
